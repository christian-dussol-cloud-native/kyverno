      Enforces Gateway API adoption for new ingress traffic routing.
      Supports progressive rollout by namespace using the label
      'migration-phase: gateway-api-required'. Can be switched from
      Audit to Enforce mode based on migration readiness.
      Note: This policy discourages traditional Ingress resources in
      labeled namespaces to encourage Gateway API adoption.

          Traditional Ingress resources are discouraged.
          
          Please use Gateway API resources instead:
          - HTTPRoute for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
          - TCPRoute for TCP traffic
          - TLSRoute for TLS passthrough

          It can be changed to Enforce mode when ready.
